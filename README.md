Contributor: Cassia Yoon  

Background:
You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications.Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring formof skin cancer.
As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animalstudy. In this study, 249 mice who were identifi ed with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens.Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was tocompare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and fi gures needed for the technical report of theclinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

The raw data can be found in "matplotlib-challenge\data"
There are two files in the above folder: "Mouse_metadata.csv" and "Study_results.csv"


For this assignment, I used Matplotlib to analyze data. The script file is "pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb"
